Open-source and privacy-conscious (thermal) camera (software) for health monitoring. 

This is work in progress. Please contact Michael Schwanzer if you would like to contribute (michael@zeitdice.com, @mschwanzer) 

### Background & Motivation
* COVID-19 seems like it will be  around for a while. A vaccine might eventually become available but the timeframe for that is unknown. Medical testing capacities (infected yes/no, antibodies yes/no) are increasing but it’s unknown how practical / available any of these tests will be to contain / monitor the spread of the virus through communities in the short / mid / even long term. As of now, we don’t even know if a proof of antibodies today means you can’t get sick again or transfer the virus again soon). Schools, offices, factories, they all want to open up again as soon as they are allowed and technology might help to reduce the risks involved. 
* We are not trying to offer a medical testing device or a 100% accurate screening solution. However, we believe that based on our expertise in making smart cameras, we can create an apparatus that can detect humans with elevated body temperature (potentially fever, an indicator of infection, potentially unknown by the host) in a way that would not interfere with anyone and their privacy unless a higher than expected body temperature is detected. 
* We believe that unless there is a better solution (vaccine?) to protect humans from COVID-19 infections in general there will be a need for a combination of several technologies to contain the spread of the virus that can and should be deployed in areas mentioned above but could also be effective in other setups. 
* We acknowlegde that there are commercial & proprietary solutions out there for human temperature screening. Contributors and sponsors of this project believe that there should also be an open-source alternative that can be trusted for not invading privacy beyond what is necessary to keep people healthy. 
* We are trying to create a solution that only uses components that can easily be procured and afterwards assembled and installed by anyone with minor technical skills. Through our partners we aim to also offer an assembled / pre-configured version at cost. 
* We believe that only open-source software of thermal visual technology can and shall be potentially trusted by the public. A major difference between thermal cameras and the CCTV style security cameras (we are used to) is thermal camera's ability to capture visual data beyond what would be seen by another human at the scene.   

### Initial Goal (might change)
* Create an easy to assemble, deploy, maintain, operate and procure parts for thermal camera apparatus that can be used to automatically (no operator needed) detect humans with elevated body temperature while least invading their privacy when they are walking by in a defined space without interfering their path (like stopping them to push a button to get a screening).
